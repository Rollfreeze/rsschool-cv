## 3 About me:
    I am a purposeful person who dreams about becoming a demanded web-developer.
    
    My priorities are learning useful courses like RS-School and using new knowledge for web-developing.
    My strong side is my perseverance. If I have a certain goal, I do everything to complete it.
    I had an internship experience of 1ะก developing, but after 3 months studing and working with it I understood that I didnt like it.
    However I proved to myself that I am more than capable of completing assigned goals.

    Now I am working as a theacher of programming for children.

## 4 Hardware-skills:
    Languages: Python, C++, C#, SQL, UML
    Development tools: VS Code, Visual Studio

## 5 Code examples:
    You can check my code examples in my git portfolio.

## 6 Work experience:
    I used to train 1C developing via 1ะก franchising firm in my Town;
    As part of the training course of the institute I have learnt C++ and Python well. I created many projects there, but more important for me is creating client-server application on Python and SQL with pretty good GUI (QT-Designer). I like this project because it's compilation of my knowledge.

    I also have learnt 2 courses for Junior-Development and created 2 simple sites.

    courses:
        * https://brainscloud.ru/landing/html-css
        * https://html.dmitrylavrik.ru/?utm=site-courses

## 7 Education:
    I am a student of 4-th course of Admiral Makarov State University of Maritime and Inland Shipping.
    My speciality is a cyber security.

## 8 English:
    My English level is approximately B1
    I traveld a lot with my parents when I was 15-17 years old and I could practice my English with other people who speaked it.
